# nodejs-kotori
this is the source code of my in-house Discord bot written in JS with the Discord.js library.
forked from DiscordBot with some custom code thrown in.
#running the bot
the bot runs without installation on node.js. simply run the command ``node /dir/of/bot/discord_bot.js`` and it would run the bot automatically. you require the Discord.js library to make it work.
you need a Bot Token so it can connect through Discord. get one at http://discordapp.com/developers
#TODO

EVERYTHING!!!

if you have any feature you want to add for that bot, simply do a merge request in master and I will review it if it's good enough to be merged on daily.
